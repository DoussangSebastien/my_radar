my_radar - Plane Flight Traffic Simulator
Project Overview

my_radar is a plane flight traffic simulator designed to visualize and simulate the behavior of planes flying within a designated airspace. The simulator tracks the planes in real-time and performs collision detection. All the information about the planes' positions, velocities, and flight paths is extracted from a .legend file.

usage:
